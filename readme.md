# 🎓 Learning Platform - Class Booking Web App

This is a **Class Booking Web Application** built during my 3rd year of college. The goal of this project was to provide a seamless way for students to book their desired courses online. It features a modern front-end built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, along with functionality to **send email confirmations** to both the user and admin upon booking.

> 🌐 Live Demo: [Visit the App] https://chetan1930.github.io/Learnign-platform/ 

## ✨ Features

- 📋 **Course Booking Form** – Users can select courses and timing preferences.
- 📧 **Email Confirmation** – Automatically sends a confirmation email to both the student and admin (powered via [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)).
- 🖥️ **Responsive Design** – Mobile-friendly and clean layout for all screen sizes.
- 🧠 **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple and intuitive UI for hassle-free class booking.
- 💡 **Built from Scratch** – No frameworks, just pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
- **EmailJS** (for sending emails)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User visits the booking form.
2. Selects a course and preferred time.
3. Submits the form.
4. The app sends a confirmation email to both the user and the admin email using EmailJS.

## 🧾 How to Use Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chetan1930/Learnign-platform.git
   cd Learnign-platform
````

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

3. To enable the email feature:

   * Sign up on [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).
   * Create an email service and email template.
   * Replace the EmailJS credentials (`user ID`, `service ID`, and `template ID`) in `script.js` with your own.

### ✅ To Do Next (Optional Improvements)
You could:
- Add form validation (required fields, email format).
- Show a success message after form submission.
- Add backend support (Node.js or Firebase) for storing booking records.

Would you like me to add badges (like Live Demo, Tech Stack) or auto-generate a Table of Contents for GitHub as well?
